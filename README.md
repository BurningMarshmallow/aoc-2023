In this repository, I will provide solutions for the Advent of Code[^aoc] puzzles using [Dart][dart] language.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
